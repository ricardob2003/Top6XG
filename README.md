## Overview
This repository contains code for a Python program that analyzes expected goals (XG) data for the top 6 premier league teams during the 23/24 season. The program scrapes data from a football statistics website, processes the data to extract XG values for each team and match, and then visualizes the XG data using Matplotlib.

## Features
- Scrapes XG data and related data from a specified website.
- Processes the scraped data to extract XG values for each the traditional top 6 teams in the Premier League.
- Visualizes the XG data for each team using Matplotlib, providing insights into their performance throughout the season.
- Provides a modular structure for easy extension and customization.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Matplotlib
- Requests (for data scraping)
- (Any other dependencies as specified in the requirements.txt file)

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the main Python script to execute the XG analysis and visualization.
